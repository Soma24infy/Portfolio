### Lending Club Case Study

We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
